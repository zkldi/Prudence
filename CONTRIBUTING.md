Be nice, I'm only one person.

# Static Function Requests

If you are requesting a new "built-in" function for Prudence, please make sure it solves an actual issue.

I don't want to balloon the library up with lots of extremely specific use cases!

# Documentation

To edit documentation, you're looking for the [Prudence-Docs](https://github.com/zkldi/prudence-docs).

# Security

If you have found a security vulnerability, please disclose it using Github's built in security advisories,
**DO NOT** make an issue about security!
